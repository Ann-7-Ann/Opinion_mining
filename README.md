# Rule-Based opinion mining
The project processes customer reviews of a restaurant in order to automatically extract meaningful phrases and assigns a sentiment polarity to them (positive + , negative - , neutral, mixed).  
It uses Natural Language Toolkit for tokenization, POS tagging and sentiment lexicon lookup.  
The reviews are provided in `reviews.txt` file. The outcome is stored in `phrases.txt` file.

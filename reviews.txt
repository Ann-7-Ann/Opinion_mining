I loveeee mensa :3 the vibes are so welcoming, there are a lot of windows letting in light, everything is clean and new, the food is different every day and they have vegan/vegetarian options! The only downside is the prices cause it's a bit expensive for a uni student to eat there every day :c But a slay overall
5/5
Daily menu with salad, main dish and a drink costs 6â‚¬ for students with Kepler card, and if it is vegetarian 4.5â‚¬. The quality is fine.
5/5
Way too expensive. The prices got up way too much in recent years, while the food quality did not.

Good food at affordable prices

Quite good for a cafeteria. Minus one star for the frequency of the same dishes which is getting boring after a couple of years. However, folks it is a cafeteria

Top!

Now and then is fine. But a bit more than just a single layer of fries on the plate would be nice at the Grillcorner. Especially after the price increases over the past two years. Or are the potatoes used for the fries now organic and therefore particularly valuable?
By the way, will there ever be schnitzel again like there used to be every Monday, or has that been rationalized away too?
3/5
For a cafeteria, the food tastes very good. Even for a small amount of money, you get a large main course, and on top of that, you can help yourself to a wide variety of salads and side dishes.
4/5
For a cafeteria and the large crowds at lunchtime, the quality is consistently high. However, anyone who eats here regularly will notice after just a few weeks that the menus repeat themselves exactly.

Affordable food, really tasty!

The beer goulash was sensationally good, and ever since the new management took over, everything has been much better anyway â€“ TOP-notch food!
5/5
Staff is very friendly.
Good for the price. Healthy dishes like the Brainfood options are usually great. It would be nice to have more small desserts like various yogurts or frappes.
Unfortunately, the food counter is quite narrow and cramped. The meal selection tends to repeat quickly.
Trays are often not clean! (Some are completely dirty and apparently not washed at all.)
4/5
Solid food at a reasonable price. A bit more variety in the menus offered (over several weeks) would be desirable.
